* algorithm improvement
# known missing function, to be added in future

1.3 Version
3/22/2016   added parameter selection panel as function for UIView
			added the option for cell to plot all channels together

3/23/2016 	* use lorentzian function for z center searching for spherical fluorescent membrane
			* use pair distance log scale double gaussian fitting to group particles to decide which particles belong to the same cell
			fixed the zscale problem in intialize fluorescent membrane shape
			fixed that GUI won't alow 'None' channel, "None" channel only holds channel data, do not start any analysis
			changed that the question box for missing values only popup in GUI mode
			replaced the varaible name 'maxdisp' under ParticleTracker3D with 'mindist'
			added script example for sample cases
			split the Cell class into Cell and CellConstructor class
			cleaned up the function name to put everything in folders

3/24/2016   added math package
            added geometry class in the math package to hold geometry related functions
            added getDistance, getPointsClusterSize, groupPoints
            * use recursion for groupPoints
            # second method of groupPoints not applied
            added constructCellByParticles, automatically group particles
            added script for ER membrane
            * randomized set intial parameters for canny edge filter to search global minimum, have the option to use longer time to search for better segementation

3/26/2016   added analysis UI: UIViewAnalysis
            added analysis module: CellAnalyzer
            added CellAnalyzer method: extractParticlePairDistance
            added CellAnalyzer method: extractParitcleContourDistance
            added export to excel

3/27/2016   changed the way UI and Movie search for possible channel types, will automatically search the package for it
            moved ChannelFluorescentMembrane3D to ChannelFluorescentMembrane3DSpherical
            added non spherical reconstruction channel ChannelFluorescentMembrane3D

3/30/2016   fixed the channel description desplay
            modified the way to pass parameters to cell constructor     
            * added 3d canny edge filter
            * added 3d image binning       
            * added 3d edge finding for binary images, support 3 kinds of connection, 6 way, 18 way and 26 way
            * added 3d morphological opertors, imopen,imclose,imdilate,ierode

3/31/2016   build module ImageSegmenterFluorescentMembrane3D
            * add scale according to bin size in Patch class
            # one error to fix in scale@Patch
            # ImageSegmenterFluorescentMembrane3D on hold
            * add bin size adjustment in spherical fitting, it will automatically run the analysis first with large bin size to find better initialization location be finely fit the nuclei
            # when runining script, new figure pop up instead of overriding
            cleaned script files
            add string converter for notation in UI files
            add option for logical type buttons
