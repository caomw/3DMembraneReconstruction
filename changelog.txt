* algorithm improvement
# known missing function, to be added in future

1.3 Version
3/22/2016   added parameter selection panel as function for UIView
			added the option for cell to plot all channels together

3/23/2016 	* use lorentzian function for z center searching for spherical fluorescent membrane
			* use pair distance log scale double gaussian fitting to group particles to decide which particles belong to the same cell
			fixed the zscale problem in intialize fluorescent membrane shape
			fixed that GUI won't alow 'None' channel, "None" channel only holds channel data, do not start any analysis
			changed that the question box for missing values only popup in GUI mode
			replaced the varaible name 'maxdisp' under ParticleTracker3D with 'mindist'
			added script example for sample cases
			split the Cell class into Cell and CellConstructor class
			cleaned up the function name to put everything in folders

3/24/2016   added math package
            added geometry class in the math package to hold geometry related functions
            added getDistance, getPointsClusterSize, groupPoints
            * use recursion for groupPoints
            # second method of groupPoints not applied
            added constructCellByParticles, automatically group particles
            added script for ER membrane
            * randomized set intial parameters for canny edge filter to search global minimum

3/26/2016   added analysis UI: UIViewAnalysis
            added analysis module: CellAnalyzer
            added CellAnalyzer method: extractParticlePairDistance
            added CellAnalyzer method: extractParitcleContourDistance
            add export to excel
